# Contributing to Ordis

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document outlines how to contribute to this project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Git

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ordis-dev/ordis
cd ordis
npm install
npm run build
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create an Issue

All work starts with a GitHub issue. Use the issue templates to ensure proper structure.

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/short-description
```

Follow the naming convention:

- `feature/short-description` (for new features)
- `bugfix/short-description` (for bug fixes)
- `hotfix/short-description` (for urgent fixes)
- `refactor/short-description` (for code improvements)

### 3. Make Changes

- Follow [code style guidelines](#code-style)
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass

### 4. Submit Pull Request

- Reference the issue number
- Include clear description of changes
- Follow PR template

## Issue Guidelines

### Issue Structure

Use the provided GitHub issue templates which include:

**Description**: Brief explanation of what needs to be done and why

**Tasks**: Specific actionable items with checkboxes

**Acceptance Criteria**: Clear, testable conditions for completion

### Issue Types

- **Feature**: New functionality or enhancement
- **Bug**: Something broken or not working as expected
- **Refactor**: Code improvement without functional changes
- **Documentation**: Updates to docs, README, or comments

### Quality Guidelines

- **Be Specific**: Tasks should be concrete and actionable
- **Be Testable**: Acceptance criteria should be verifiable
- **Right-Sized**: Issues should be completable in a reasonable timeframe

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use strict mode enabled in tsconfig.json
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use descriptive variable names
- Follow the existing patterns in the codebase

### Project Structure

```
src/
├── cli.ts           # CLI entrypoint and argument parsing
├── core/            # Schema validation, parsing, error handling
├── schemas/         # Schema definitions and validation logic
├── llm/             # LLM client wrappers (OpenAI-compatible)
└── utils/           # Shared utilities
examples/            # Sample schemas and input files
```

### Conventions

- **Separation of concerns**: Keep schema definitions, validation logic, and LLM integration separate
- **Descriptive naming**: Use clear names for schema files (e.g., `invoice.schema.json`, `address.schema.json`)
- **No magic**: Explicit behavior over hidden retries or silent corrections
- **Useful errors**: Return structured, descriptive errors that explain what went wrong and where
- **Configuration**: Store API keys and endpoints in `.env` (never commit)

## Development Commands

- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm run dev` - Run CLI directly with tsx (no build needed)
- `npm run clean` - Remove build artifacts
- `node dist/cli.js --help` - Show CLI help
- `node dist/cli.js extract [options]` - Test extraction command

## Pull Request Process

### Before Creating PR

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with main
2. Run `npm run build` to verify compilation
3. Test CLI functionality with sample data
4. Review your changes for any debug code or temporary changes

### PR Requirements

- **Clear title**: Use the same format as your branch name
- **Reference issue**: Always link to the related issue with "Fixes #X"
- **Complete template**: Fill out all sections of the PR template
- **Self-review**: Review your own changes before submitting

### PR Template Sections

- **Summary**: Brief description of what the PR accomplishes
- **Related Issue**: Link to the GitHub issue this addresses
- **Changes**: Bullet list of specific changes made
- **Testing**: How you verified the changes work
- **Type of Change**: Category of the change (feature, bug fix, etc.)
- **Documentation**: What docs were updated
- **Checklist**: Verification items before merge

### Review Process

1. Create PR referencing the issue number
2. Get review approval from maintainer
3. Address any feedback or requested changes
4. Once approved, maintainer will squash and merge
5. Original branch will be deleted after merge

6. Ensure your branch is up to date with main
7. Run `npm run build` to verify compilation
8. Test CLI functionality with sample data
9. Create PR referencing the issue number
10. Get review approval
11. Squash and merge

## Core Principles

When contributing, keep these principles in mind:

- **Schema first, not prompt first**: Schemas define what "correct" means before the model sees input
- **Treat model output as untrusted**: All LLM responses are validated against the schema
- **Deterministic output or clear failure**: No silent corrections or "close enough" results
- **Small, boring pipelines**: Clear steps (input → model → validate → output) without hidden magic
- **I/O at the edges**: Core engine handles validation; clients handle LLM calls, files, and APIs

## Questions?

- Check existing issues and discussions
- Ask questions in the issue thread
- Open a discussion for general questions
- Review the project README for basic usage
